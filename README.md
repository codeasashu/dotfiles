# Welcome to my dotfiles

This is my personal workstation configs which I happen to also share with any other machines I own, since I love arch anyway.

# Getting Started

There is not much to it. This repo is good to go for a docker devops who can code in python and Go

After Installing arch linux, you can just do

```
   git clone https://github.com/codeasashu/dotfiles --recursive ~/.dotfiles
   
   cd ~/.dotfiles && ./install
```

You may also want to `chmod +x ./install` before running.
